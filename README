Config-Cascade-0.01

Config::Cascade is intended to supply the user with easily managable cascading 
configurations. A series of scripts can be given a common global config, more
specific configuration files, and the option to override any config options 
from the command line. Configuration files use a simple syntax, and are validated
using various regexp functions to warn the user when they include unknown or 
improperly formatted configuration options.

This module requires Regexp::Common.
